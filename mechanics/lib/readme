gears:
To make changes to the library I decided to fork it.
see: https://github.com/erichstuder/gears
It also gives me the possibility to provide releases.
As I don't wan't to include it as a submodule I decided to include it that way.
Credit to all contributers for their awesome work!
Licensing applies as described in the library (see gears/LICENSE.txt).
